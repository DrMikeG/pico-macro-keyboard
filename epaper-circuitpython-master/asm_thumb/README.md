# ARM Assembly CircuitPython Fractal Optimizations

This package is where the fun continues... when originally writing
the code, I was happy in the "Yay, it works!" sense, but wasn't
satisfied with the speed _and_ wanted to get my hands dirty with
a fancy MicroPython feature to learn some ARM assembly.

A microcontroller running at 25x the clock speed of my old PCjr
should have no trouble spitting out fractals in the blink of an eye,
made even easier as the M4 has floating point hardware!
Challenge accepted, lets give it a whirl.

## Prerequisite: Build a custom CircuitPython (!)

To use any code in this subdirectory you will need to make a custom
build of [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) 3
or later and flash it to your device.  Edit the
`ports/atmel-samd/mpconfigport.h` file and ensure the following
lines are present.  By default, if they exist, they are probably `(0)`
to disable the feature to save space instead of our required `(1)`.

```c
#define MICROPY_EMIT_INLINE_THUMB   (1)
#define MICROPY_EMIT_INLINE_THUMB_FLOAT (1)
```

With that change saved, build your atmel-samd interpreter following the normal
CircuitPython build instructions and it will be `@micropython.asm_thumb`
enabled.

# Performance Results

Using the `third_party.waveshare.epd2in7` display size (176x264) on my Adafruit
Metro M4 Express (120Mhz SAMD51J19) under CircuitPython 3.0 I observed this
Julia fractal computation performance.

## Original optimized pure CircuitPython 3.0 code.

23.9 seconds

## + `_fractal_iterate()` implemented using asm.

12.4 seconds

## + `MonoBitmap.set_pixel` implemented using asm.

7.74 seconds

### + Removing the `use_julia` conditional.

7.5 seconds

## Reimplement the entire `for x in range(width)` loop using asm.

0.211 seconds

## + Fix the bug in the above code.

0.199 seconds - now that we are computing the correct thing.

## + Optimize the x-loop assembly code.

**0.156 seconds**!

Instructions and memory loads were moved outside of loops and the 14 cycle
`vsqrt` instruction was removed by rethinking our math needs.

## + Stop printing a `*` to the serial console every row

**0.140 seconds**

A full *170x faster* than the original optimized Python code.

## Couldn't we optimize more?

Yes.  The next obvious step would be to move the `for y in range(height)`
loop into assembly.  If we weren't already an order of magnitude faster
than the slow e-Paper displays this code was originally a demo for, that
might make sense.  For that purpose, we've already outdone ourselves. :)

## What about CircuitPython 4.1?

It is noticably faster due to 4.1 enabling some overlooked micropython compile
time optimizations.  The pure CircuitPython 4.1 Julia fractal computation drops
from our previous 23.9 down to 16.3 seconds.  The asm version is 0.137 seconds.
We're only *119x faster* now. :P

# You Made This Look Too Easy a.k.a. How Hard Was This?

It wasn't easy!  I spent numerous multi-hour stretches on random evenings
or weekends in early 2018 weeks hammering this out.  I wasn't using git
to track my work at the time, though I saved various snapshots of my progress
which I used to recreate parts of my journey in this repository.

## Challenge: Debugging `@micropython.asm_thumb` Code

It is painful.  This code is ultimately native asm, you cannot simply do
the equivalent of `print()` debugging or even try things out in a REPL
as you can with normal Python code.  Despite its appearance to fit within
Python syntax, this really is just a weird looking subset of ARM Thumb
assembly.

In the earlier `_fractal_iterate` version of the code you may have noticed that
I made the `fast_in` array extra large and left some debugging code commented
out.  That was from a debugging effort where I had it export some internal
state so I could attempt to reason about what was or wasn't going right
internally.

## An Example bug fixed along the way

Fixed now, but I made commit 0d3efe94c84b84237c1e3193fe5746fa5c2eec7c with a
known issue in my x-loop assembly code.  Can you spot it?  If so, you must have
the ARM Thumb architecture reference manual memorized.  :P  It took me a very
long time to debug that one.  I only noticed it when I started playing with a
newly acquired epd2in9 display which made me actually look closely at what was
on the screen...  One row of pixels at the edge was simply wrong.  Look at
the diff to see why.  I spent many hours over many days puzzling over that.

# Future Work

MicroPython is _supposed_ to support non-assembly optimization features via
`@micropython.native` (similar to Cython) and a Numba like `@micropython.viper`
dynamic compiler.

I'd love to test out their performance, but I have been unable to get them to
build properly in my circuitpython tree.  Viper might do well for the
`MonoBitmap.set_pixel` function, but without support for floats it would not be
of much help for the inner loop complex math iteration.

It is also possible to write fractal algorithms using only integers.  Great for
running on previous generation smaller MCUs without floating point.  The
[famous fractint](https://fractint.org) program has been a repository of that
art for decades.  If you are really looking to get fractals on a smaller MCU
without floating point, you may find inspiration there.  There are also a
people who have made real time [FPGA implementations of
Mandlebrot](https://www.google.com/search?q=fpga+mandlebrot).  Who needs a
microcontroller at all?

# Caveats

Writing native assembly is instructive (pun intended!) but extremely difficult
to maintain.  Do it to learn, but it should always be a last resort.
